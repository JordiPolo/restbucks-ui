# Restbucks UI

This is the accompaining UI for the [Ruby restbucks
implementation](https://github.com/cwabbott/restbucks).

It consumes and allow the user to interact with the workflow presented
in the [original restbucks article](http://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow).

It includes also the functionality to pickup the drink.

This was created to try to get some understanding on how to use
hypermedia in the real world. Cowboy coding with no tests.
